Update Notes: 
 - Button that skipped credential check for ease of building has been removed, now credentials must be entered to log in.
 - Call to close connection in credential check function has been removed, was causing subsequent functions that relied on connection to throw errors.
 - Report model now has missing necessary setters/getters that coused report page to not load required reports.

## Directions for application

The program opens on a log-in screen that requires a user name and password to be entered that match values found in the mysql database. Language is automatically set on the log-in screen but can be manually changed as well.
Once successfully logged in, main appointment screen is shown and has options for different views as well as buttons that access screens for adding and updating either appointments or customers, as well as a reports screen.

Reports screen displays an additional report that lists all users and the number of appointments they each have.
